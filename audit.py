"""
The audit log.

Every decision your service makes gets written here as one JSON object per
line. Not `print()` — a file you can read back.

The reason is next week: you run an attack against this service, and **an
attack you can't see in a log is an attack you can't diagnose.** An input that
slipped past your detector leaves no other trace.

All nine fields the unit 8 rubric requires are in the entry shape from the
start, even though unit 7 only fills some of them. That's deliberate — adding
fields later means your early entries and your late ones have different shapes,
and the one you most want to compare is the one from before the change.
