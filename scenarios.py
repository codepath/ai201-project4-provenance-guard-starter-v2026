What your test runs. ← UNIT 8, MILESTONE 3

Each of your five criteria needs something run against it. A criterion about
false positives needs your own writing. One about label coverage needs inputs
across the score range. One about the appeal path needs a real content_id.

Working that out is Milestone 3's first step, and this file is where you write
it down. `run_eval.py` runs everything here three times.

Two are filled in as examples. Replace them with what your criteria actually
need — these are a shape, not a set.

A scenario carries **either** of these:

    "texts"   a list of strings. Each is sent as {"text": ..., "creator_id": ...}
              with a creator_id made up for you. Use this for most criteria.

    "bodies"  a list of whole request bodies, sent exactly as written. Use this
              when the malformed request IS the point — empty text, no `text`
              field at all, something enormous. A bad-input criterion needs it,
              because you cannot express "the field is missing" as a string.

    # and run_eval.py to do it. Saying which you did is part of the write-up.
